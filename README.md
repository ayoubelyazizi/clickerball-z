# Solo Project On LARAVEL 8

This project was made by [**Ayoube El Yazizi**](https://github.com/ayoubelyazizi).

Began the **22th** of February; deadline the **26th** of February.

## What was asked ? 

I had to make a "clicker" game like [this one](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), but with the JS framework React, to learn how "states" works and how to do some JSX.

## What did i do ?
I watched some tutorials to learn about "state" and the React's hooks.
I've done something pretty good, knowing that I've never done React before and in a few days I've managed to make it work well, it's largely improvable but for the time I had it's a good start.

## What works ?

Everything works on my site but I didn't manage to make a github page because I didn't do that with "npx create-react-app" but I downloaded everything manually using "npm i react-dom parcel-bundler". So to test it will have to clone it and download the necessary dependencies, which you can find on the file "package.json" then just run the command "npm run dev" and enjoy!

## What did i use ? 

* React 
* JS
* HTML 5
* CSS 3

**P.S. :** There is only one commit because I restarted the project several times on different repo's, so this version I first finished it on my pc before creating a new repo.
